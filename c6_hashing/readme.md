* in array hashing we were taking more element space if even element not exist
* using map we storing element that exist



* map automatic store value in ascending order; unordered_map stores in any sequence

* fetching or creating map take log(N) time Complexity in best,avg and worst
* storing and searching take O(1) in unorderd map in avg and best case and O(N) in worst
* worst happen in unorderd map in collision situation
* try to use uuorederd_map first if time limit exceed warning then only use map

1. Division Method
2. Folding Method
3. Mid Square Method
